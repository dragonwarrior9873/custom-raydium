# 🎉 New UI is live on Beta


What’s up Raydiatooors? 

Raydium's new UI is finally here!

We appreciate your patience! Having encountered a number of "growing pains" due to an influx of new users and high-traffic events like AcceleRaytor launches in recent months, significant resources have been spent on less user-facing infrastructure improvements to ensure things are up to speed. **However Raydium’s updated UI has now arrived!** Some features like the Trading and AcceleRaytor pages are still under development.

Keep in mind that this Beta version is still a work in progress, so we’d love to hear your thoughts. Have feedback? Let us know in our [feature-requests channel in discord](http://discord.gg/raydium)

The new UI has also been re-built on top of [Raydium’s comprehensive SDK](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-sdk). The SDK also took countless hours to build out, but now means that future updates, improvements, and integrations with other projects can happen much more smoothly.

*Please note that this is a beta version of Raydium V2, which is still undergoing final testing before official release. The platform, its software and all content found on it are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Raydium does not give any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the suitability or usability of the website.*
